Wave Phenomena Studies
======================

Some tools to study wave phenomena computational and mathematical implications


TO INSTALL
==========

1. Clone repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/igormorgado/wave
```

2. Build
```
$ cd wave
# make wave
```


RECOMENDATIONS
==============

Is good to install seismic unix for visualization tool


HOW TO USE
==========

**wave**: creates a wavefield.

**oldwave**: Creates a wavefield (deprecated).

**d2a**: convert binary double data to ascii data (to fill empty disks)

**d2f**: convert binary double data to binary float data (necessary to use seismic unix visualization tools

**bfdiff**: calculate the difference between two binary float files 

**bddiff**: calculate the difference between two binary double files
